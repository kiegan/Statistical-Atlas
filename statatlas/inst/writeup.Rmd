#  * done, they are going to follow up with more information
  
#Is there a way to set up a warning for variables that might change names over time?

#Visualizations 
#  - Compare slaves to free (color scale like election example)
#  - Use USAboundaries
#  - Facet when using different variables (slaves, free, etc)
#  - Log scale for numbers?

## Introduction  

## Background (Literature Review)  

## Work  

### Motivation  

### Description  

### Example  

Questions for Dr. Hofmann about Example:  
  - Could we do a discrete scale that is the same for all years? May be hard since the population increases over time, but it would allow us to compare charts across years. 
  - Years comparing 'SLAVES', 'TOTAL.FREE.COLORED.PERSONS', and 'PERC.AFRICAN.AMERICANS.FREE', can we put these next to each other or just look at them individually?

### Implementation  

## Discussion of Future Work
