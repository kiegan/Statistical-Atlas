### Choosing your variables  

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(statatlas)
shinyUI(navbarPage("Get Your Data",
  tabPanel("Single Year", 
           inputPanel(
  selectInput("year", label = "Census Year:",
              choices = 10*179:196, selected = 1790),
  
  textInput("topic", label = "Variable of Interest:", value = ""),
  
  textInput("topic2", label = "Secondary Variable:", value = "")
), renderTable({
  library(statatlas)
  data(stateslist)
  variables <- names(stateslist[[paste0("X",input$year)]])
  variable1 = variables[grep(input$topic, variables)]
  variable2 = variables[grep(input$topic2, variables)]
  data.frame(available_colnames = variable1[variable1 %in% variable2])
})),

  tabPanel("Multiple Years", {inputPanel(
  sliderInput("range", label = "Range of Years",
              min = 1790, max = 1960, step = 10, sep = "", value = c(1790, 1820)),
  
  textInput("topic3", label = "Variable of Interest:",
              value = "")
)})
))
```
## append all of the variable names for all of the years, then shrink down by unique, then create a binary as to whether they are in the unique or not. Mark with a check or X where they match. 
## leave as a table, and denote how many of the selected years also have that column.

## data table that shows which years the variable is present (each year is a column), and then another column that says how many of the years it is present (sum)
