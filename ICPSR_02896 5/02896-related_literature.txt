Working Paper No. 21952. Cambridge, MA: National Bureau of Economic

Abstract: http://www.nber.org/papers/w21952
Full text PDF: http://www.nber.org/papers/w21952.pdf
We study the impact of the introduction of a form of bankruptcy protection
on household investment in the U.S. South in the 1840s, which predated
modern bankruptcy laws. During this period, certain southern states passed
laws that protected married women's property from seizure in the case of
insolvency, amending the common law default which vested a wife's property
in her husband and thus allowed it to be seized for the repayment of his
debts. Importantly, these laws only applied to newlyweds. We compare
couples married after the passage of a law with couples from the same state
who married before the passage of a law. Since states passed laws at
different points in time, we can exploit variation in protection
conditional on state and year of marriage. We find that the effect on
household investment was heterogeneous: if most household wealth came from
the husband (wife), the law led to an increase (decrease) in investment.
This is consistent with a simple model where downside protection leads to
both an increase in the demand for credit and a reduction in supply. Demand
effects will only dominate if a modest fraction of total wealth is
protected.
