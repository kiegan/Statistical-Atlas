## messing around with it to see what we are dealing with
```{r}
#states1790 <- read.csv("~/Statistical-Atlas/raw-data/1790 State Level Census Data.csv", skip = 22)
#head(states1790)

#states1790.1 <- states1790[1:18,]
```

```{r}
#states1800 <- read.csv("~/Statistical-Atlas/raw-data/1800 State Level Census Data.csv", skip = 22)
#head(states1800)

#states1800.1 <- states1800[1:19,]
```


```{r}
remove.commas <- function(X){
  as.numeric(gsub(",", "", X))
}

get.states <- function(filename, year){
  df <- read.csv(filename, skip=22, na.string="N/A")
  df <- df[(3:(dim(df)[1]-24)),]
  df.2 <- apply(X = df[,-1], MARGIN = 2, FUN = remove.commas)
  df <- data.frame("Year" = year, "State" = df[,1], df.2)
  # if 'State' column = "State" or "" <- bye
  df <- df[!(df$State == "State" | df$State == ""),]
  df$Type <- ifelse(grepl("(territory)", df$State) == TRUE, "Territory", "State")
  # add column 'type' state, territory, other
  df$State <- gsub(" \\(territory\\)", "", df$State)
  return(df)
}

# save clean data into separate R files and put into package
states1790 <- get.states("~/Statistical-Atlas/raw-data/1790 State Level Census Data.csv", 1790)
save(states1790, file = "~/Statistical-Atlas/statatlas/data/states1790.rda")


## repeat this for each year
states1960 <- get.states("~/Statistical-Atlas/raw-data/1960 State Level Census Data.csv", 1960)
save(states1960, file = "~/Statistical-Atlas/statatlas/data/states1960.rda")

## special fix for 1940
#states1940 <- get.states("~/Statistical-Atlas/raw-data/1940 State Level Census Data.csv", 1940)
#colnames(states1940)[3] <- "TOTAL.POPULATION" # changing "TOTAL.POPULATION..1940" to just "TOTAL.POPULATION"
#save(states1940, file = "~/Statistical-Atlas/statatlas/data/states1940.rda")


# put all of them into one file (rbind)
# how much do the names match up with what was actually asked in the census
  # keep the names and document changes, but changing names could be a good idea
