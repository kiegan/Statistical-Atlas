#Write-up


# geom_path, grey90 (close to white), do a background of all the states of the U.S. (1960 map)

# sign up for NHGIS and get county-level data to see how big of a mess it would be (one year or two years)
# create a list in the same way states are done - county1790, county1800, etc. 
# separate download button for county vs. state.
# maybe also get the state-level from 1890 from NHGIS to see if we can match up some of the variable names

# make fig.width wider if we want to put some of the charts next to each other. 

## UPDATES: (4/6/17)
# ICPSR data doesn't give column names. It describes what tables the variables come from, but the .txt file of the data doesn't actually include names.
# NHGIS doesn't have the same 'files'. The variables are not in the same order when you go to select what data you want. 
# U.S. Census Bureau only has available back until 1990 (as far as I can tell)
# Still need to look at making a time series
# Still trying to get the faint outline of the states on my images


## Correlation between variables from spss file and states1890 - to find which ones match (match state names first)
## Also be sure to do the Euclidean distance - correlation is pretty likely anyways because it is a state-to-state, and proportionally the numbers in different states for various variables will be similar. 

## NOTES DURING WRITING : 
  # How do I rotate images? (.pdf from figures folder)
  # How do I get the images to not take up an entire page (ugh)
  # Should I write a function to combine multiple .csv files with different variables from the same year to be exported?
  # Could also write a function to combine multiple different .csv files with varying distinctions for the same demographic group over all time
      # This one could also just be suggesting "use full_join"
  # WTF is the plural of census?
  # Should I do a percentage of total population graphic as well? Perhaps following the abolition of slavery in 1850, this would be something interesting to investigate.

\section{Introduction}  
Census data provide an important snapshot of information about a country at different times throughout its history, and their value is difficult to overstate.  While history books present a narrative of the events that occured, students themselves often don't get to interact with the raw data in that learning environment. Clean and accessible census data allow the exploration of different demographic groups over time, or investigations of a particular period of time and what the demographic and economic landscape looked like in the past. Even today, data about the world around us opens a pathway for learning more about places we haven't been and groups of people with whom we may not usually engage.  

From an early point in the United States' history, there were many "eminent men of science" who recognized the value of the census data and worked to aggregate and present those data. Francis A. Walker's "Statistical Atlas of the United States", based on the 1870 census, was an impressive effort in aggregating population data to present them in a visually appealing way [@StatisticalAtlas]. Although the Census Bureau's "Statistical Atlases" eventually stopped being created, they were an important start to the effort of visually presenting census data to a wider public (see Figure 1).  

![An example of a visualization of data from the Statistical Atlas based on the 1870 census.](./figures/colored-population-stat-atlas.png){ width=90% }


Today, as methods of data analysis and visualization continue to be developed and improved, access to census data allows us to look back on that history and explore, synthesize, and visualize the information. When aggregated and presented in a clear manner, viewers can learn more about patterns in many different parts of the population. A 2007 paper about the Statistical Atlas discusses just how much information is present in those original charts and demonstrates several other ways of presenting the information that can be found therein [@ChartInterview].  

Ever-improving visualization and data-wrangling methods in R [@RCoreTeam] give those interested in statistical graphics a wealth of opportunities to explore and learn from data; in particular, incorporating user interactivity using Shiny has revolutionized the way statisticians share and communicate information [@Shiny]. However, it is difficult to make use of these tools with census data if those data are not available and easy to explore in one location.  

An inherent problem in census data is that a country's census changes over time; the variables collected, how they are collected, and even the locations on which they are collected are updated as the country is formed, and subsequently grows and changes. The United States census data are no exception to this rule. In little under two and a half centuries, the census has taken many different forms. Data on occupations have transformed as the employment landscape has changed; new states have been formed, the most recent being within the last 100 years; definitions of various demographic groups and the terminology used to describe them have been updated as the demographic makeup of the country has changed. Each decennial census brings a different set of variables to the table. Sometimes these variables are new things the Census Bureau is interested in learning about, while sometimes they remove variables that are no longer relevant or whose information is captured elsewhere.  

Unfortunately, because the founders of the U.S. Census were unable to see 200 years into the future, those interested in working with census data are left with quite the inescapable mess. If you want to focus in on a particular demographic group and their journey as part of the population of the United States, you may have ten or more different variable names to describe that one group over the course of the census from 1790 to 1960 - and that is just for a single group! Of course, we cannot just simply change variable names to match our own research needs. It is important to keep the data in their true form and be respectful of the way in which the population was defined at different times throughout history, even if our instinct may be to 'clean' the data by changing variable names.  

This, of course, leaves the user with a wide variety of variables that are far from consistent across years. In order to track one demographic group across years - let alone many groups - a clean user interface that helps users see exactly what information is available to them is a necessity. To streamline the process and assist researchers in finding out to what information they have access and what information they lack, a U.S. Census Browser for R is presented as an R package, with the user interface being a Shiny application, and the downloadable files being 'tidy' comma-separated values (csv) files that those with a minimal amount of R experience can still process.  



\section{Data Access}  

There are two main datasets that contain the aggregated counts of historical, demographic, economic, and social characteristics from the United States decennial census. They were both collected and developed by the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR). The ICPSR 3, gathered from computer-readable data collections from the U.S. Census Bureau as well as other reports (both published and unpublished), contains data from 1790 to 1960. The ICPSR 2896 includes much of the same information as the ICPSR 3, and in addition also includes a wider array of variables such as manufacturing and more county and city-level information. The ICPSR 2896 is a restricted-access dataset that requires users be part of a member institution in order to gain access.  


The University of Virginia Library hosted a "Historical Census Browser" for many years that allowed users to search United States Decennial Census Data for research, teaching, and personal purposes [@HCB]. The data included records on various aspects of the U.S. population from the 1790 Census through the 1960 Census, originally populated using the ICPSR 3 dataset. This Historical Census Browser was free and available for use by anyone with an internet connection. The browser allowed a user to peruse available topics for each census year at both the state and county levels. The Historical Census Browser was taken down on December 31, 2016, but the county-level aggregated data had already become unavailable several months before then. The resource was widely used, with several other university libraries and educational resources \textit{THIS IS AWKWARD. CHANGE IT. including University of California Santa Barbara [@UCSB-US-HCB], University of Pennsylvania [@UPenn-HCB], University of Michigan [@UMich-HCB], and the Smithsonian's History Explorer [@SmithsonianHistoryExplorer] directing researchers to use the University of Virginia site}.  

The University of Virginia Libraries website now directs users to Social Explorer or the National Historical Geographic Information System (NHGIS) website. Social Explorer, populated with the ICPSR 2896 data, requires that users pay (or use through paid library access) and  does not offer a complete download of information. NHGIS, hosted by the University of Minnesota, is difficult for users to navigate when looking for specific information across multiple years. The Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS USA), also hosted by the University of Minnesota, gives microsamples of census data on a finer grid - by person and household. However, it lacks state-aggregated data. The Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan, which hosts the ICPSR database, has both the full ICPSR 2896 dataset and the full ICPSR 3 dataset. Each of these are split into a separate data set for each year and split by county and state. This database requires that users be a part of a member institution, and requires users to agree that they will not distribute the information in any way after gaining access to it. It also does not have any browser functionality for users to look at the data - they must download the file for each year in either a SAS, SPSS, ASCII, or Stata format.   

None of the aforementioned resources provide the full advantages that the Historical Census Browser offered: a free-to-use and user-friendly data browser that allows users to choose which data they are interested in using, and download the complete aggregated records for their own independent use. Having the data provided by the Historical Census Browser available once again and streamlined for simple and easy data browsing is a valuable resource for researchers and others alike.    


\section{Work}   

\subsection{Data}  
Although the county-level data had already been removed from the website, we captured the state-level aggregated records for each decennial census from 1790 through 1960 from the website in September of 2016 and saved them as raw data. The goal was to create a resource for R users that allowed the same main functionalities of the original University of Virginia Historical Census Browser, streamlined for easy data searches and data management.  

The majority of files for the decennial censuses were complete upon capture from the website. However, two years of census data were missing a number of variable names and thus needed to be verified. For the 1890 and 1940 censuses, we compared each variable to all variables from the corresponding ICPSR 3 data file by both correlation and Euclidean distance. Consequently, we were able to be correctly identify some of the missing labels by completing the following steps. The variable from ICPSR 3 with the highest correlation and the lowest Euclidean distance to the raw data variable in question was selected as a potential "match", and the correlation and distance values recorded. If the candidate variable from ICPSR and the column with the raw data had a correlation greater than .999 and a Euclidean distance below 100, then we automatically declared a "match" and labeled the raw data columns accordingly. If that variable from ICPSR had a correlation greater than .95 and a Euclidean distance below 5000, we checked the correspondence by hand. We were able to verify some additional variables this way. All other columns that did not fit these criterion were considered to be unverified data, and were thus removed from the data included in the package.  


\begin{table}[H]
\centering

  \begin{tabular}{l|c|c|c|c}
  \hline
  Year & Automatically Verified & Verified by Hand & Unverified & Total \\ \hline
  1890 & 37 & 9 & 121 & 167 \\ 
  1940 & 284 & 3 & 94 & 381 \\ 
  \end{tabular}

  \caption{Counts of variables after going through the verification process.}
  \label{verify-table}
\end{table}



We managed to verify a larger proportion of the 1940 varaibles than of the 1890 columns (see Table 1). Many of the unverified columns in 1890 most likely corresponded to farming and manufacturing variables, as the ICPSR 3 did not include this information but the original data from the University of Virginia Historical Census Browser included variables of that type. Due to the need to verify using the ICPSR 3, there is a loss of some of the additional information that would have been an asset to the census browser for the 1890 year. This loss is minimal in the 1940 data.  



![Classification of variables in raw 1890 census data after comparing to the ICPSR 3 data.](./figures/verification.png){ width=70% }  


Data were organized as follows. Each separate file corresponded to year. Rows represented states, and columns corresponded to demographic variables. Entries in the table were state-aggregated counts of number of people in that category. Each state was given a label `Type` as either a State or Territory, as some U.S. territories participated in the decennial census before they received full statehood. Each individual file is labeled as `states` followed by the year of the census, (e.g. `states1790`) in this package. We combined the state-level datasets into one list, `stateslist`, which is the list of data that is used to populate the census browser.  



\subsection{Description}  

The package includes the state-aggregated data for each individual year, as well as a list of all of the years together. We expect that users will interact with these data sources via the Shiny application, `Get Your Data`. This interactive Shiny application presents the user with two options - focusing on a single year of the census, found in the `Single Year` tab, or focusing on multiple years at once, found in the `Multiple Years` tab.  

The `Single Year` tab allows users to choose a year from a drop-down menu; two manual-search entry boxes permit searching for variables of interest. For example, if a user is interested in the prevalence of farms in 1860, they can select 1860 and then search for "farms" in the first "Variable of Interest" field (see Figure 3). Users will then see a complete list of all variable names in that particular year that contain "farms" in their title. With this list now available, users can select each variable they want by clicking on it. Once all desired variables have been selected, clicking on the "Download Filtered Data" button will open a window in which the user can choose a file name and directory location for saving the resulting comma-separated values file. Variables will not remain selected if the user chooses to change their search term or add a second search term. However, if the user has interest in many separate variables that require different search terms, it is easy to combine multiple csv files in R using `full_join` from the `dplyr` package and specifying `State`, `Year`, `TOTAL.POPULATION`, and `Type` as the variables by which to join. These four variables will always be included in the resulting csv file, whether the user selects them or not.   

```{r, echo = F, fig.width = 8, fig.pos =  "H", fig.cap = "The resulting view of a search for farms in the 1860 U.S. Census on the `Single Year` tab of the `Get Your Data` app."}
knitr::include_graphics("./figures/app-sshot-farms.png")
```




The `Multiple Years` tab allows users to look for variables of interest over a range of years. It offers all decennial censuses from 1790 to 1960, and includes the same search tool as before, but only allows users to narrow down results by one search term rather than the two provided in the `Single Year` tab. Users can select the range of years in which they are interested by using the slider tool to specify the range of interest, and subsequently use the "Variable of Interest" search bar to narrow down their results. The results, which are now two-dimensional rather than just a single list of available variables, are presented somewhat differently in the `Multiple Years` tab. Each available variable is listed along the left side of the interface, and each selected year is presented across the top as a column in the table (see Figure 4). For each variable in the table, an `X` indicates whether the variable is available in that particular year. Far to the right, there is a column which indicates the number of selected years that include that particular variable. Users can choose to order the results by this count, if they wish. This is where it is important to remember that variable names for different demographic groups can change drastically over the course of the decennial census, and thus users will want to be cognizant of varying search terms that may need to be checked. For some of these terms, a notification will pop up for the user in the corner of the app. The notification states that the term the user is searching for may change over time. While this feature is not yet active for every difference in the data, it can act as an early warning system for some differences that we have already identified.  

Similar to the output file of the `Single Year` tab, once a user selects all variables of interest, she/he can select the "Download Filtered Data" button to download a csv file of the chosen variables for all states across the selected years. For years in the selected range that do not include a particular variable, the csv file will be filled in with `NA` values. This allows the structure of the data table to remain intact although there are some year-variable combinations that do not exist in the data. As mentioned previously, because of the changing nature of variable names in the decennial census, users may have to search for several separate terms, download each file separately, and combine them once the files are downloaded. The files can be combined using `full_join` as we discussed earlier. Multiple files are easy to combine because the structure ensures that key variables needed to add on new columns are in place, regardless of which variables users choose to download. This results in one data table where each row represents a year-state combination and all variables of interest are represented as columns. Users can easily filter on specific variables or years while still maintaining the original full data set, which is advantageous for visualizing how a demographic group changes over time.  



\subsection{Example}  

The `Get Your Data` Shiny app can be used to search for a topic, find the data of interest, download state-level information, and tell a visual story of populations in the United States over time. To demonstrate the utility of this Shiny app, we walk through an example on the history of the African American population in the United States. We begin by running the Shiny app: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(shiny)
shiny::runGitHub("kiegan/censusbrowseR", subdir = "shiny")
```

The default set of years is 1790 to 1880. However, the slider range can be expanded to be able to explore data across all the available years.  

![An example of available column names for the years 1790 to 1880.](./figures/app-sshot-multiple-years.png)  

After ordering by how many years each variable appears in, the available variable names show a serious lack of continuity. The four ever-present variables (`Year`, `State`, `TOTAL.POPULATION`, and `Type`) each appear ten times, once in each year selected. After that, the next most common variable only appears in four of the ten years we have chosen. This highlights some of the hurdles that we will encounter when tracking any demographic group over time. 

Since the focus will be on African Americans throughout U.S. history, the first search term needed is `SLAVE` in the early years of the U.S. census. The vast majority of African Americans were slaves when the United States was founded, so variables that count the number of slaves tell the story about the African American population in early U.S. history. Note that the `SLAVE` categorization is the only term the U.S. census had related to African Americans in the early years of the census, so it is also the only source of information available on that group for that time period.  


Once we have selected a range of years, we then enter a search term. Searching for `SLAVE` results in a list of all the candidate variable names across all years, which can again be sorted by their frequency across years. The results of this search can be seen in Figure 5.  

![The resulting table after searching for the term 'slave' in the `Get Your Data` app.](./figures/app-sshot-slave.png)

For this example, we executed three separate searches within the `Get Your Data` app, using three different terms that the census used to categorize African Americans at different points in the decennial census ("slave", "colored", and "negro"). The third of these terms, when used for plotting, will be labeled as "black" for the remainder of the example. This gave three separate csv files, which were combined using the function `full_join` from the `dplyr` package. Now, for this demographic group, all of the state-aggregated population counts are together in one data frame, although different terms are used at different points in time.  

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(statatlas)
library(tidyverse)
library(USAboundaries)
library(broom)
library(maptools)
library(gridExtra)
library(ggthemes)
library(scales)
data_c <- readr::read_csv("./counts-using-word-colored.csv")
data_s <- readr::read_csv("./counts-using-word-slave.csv")
data_n <- readr::read_csv("./counts-using-word-negro.csv")

data_full <- full_join(data_s, data_c, by = c("Year", "State", "TOTAL.POPULATION", "Type"))
#data_full %>% glimpse

data_full <- full_join(data_full, data_n, by = c("Year", "State", "TOTAL.POPULATION", "Type"))
#data_full %>% glimpse


states_current <- us_boundaries("1999-12-31")
mcurr_df <- fortify(states_current, region = "name")
mcurr_df <- mcurr_df %>% mutate(State = toupper(id)) %>% filter(long >= -127)

```


The combined data can now be explored. For any particular year, a subset of the full dataset can be taken to include only information for that year. This allows for quicker determination of which variables are available for that particular year. For example, after subsetting on the year 1790,  state-level counts of the `SLAVES` variable for that year can be plotted. Use of the `USAboundaries` package in concert with this census browser is recommended, as it provides the most accurate boundaries of the United States at any given date [@USAboundaries]. Just as variable names and the make-up of the census rapidly changed throughout the United States' history, the boundaries of the states and territories changed as well. The recorded state-aggregated values in the dataset are for the states as they existed during that census year, and thus sometimes include demographic counts from areas that differ from the currently defined state boundaries.  



```{r chunk-1790-map, fig.width = 6.66, fig.height = 4, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.pos = "H", fig.cap = "Total number of slaves per state in 1790, plotted on a continuous log scale. State boundaries for July 4, 1790 were gathered from `USAboundaries` package."}
map_states_1790 <- us_boundaries("1790-07-04")

m1790_df <- fortify(map_states_1790, region = "name")
m1790_df <- m1790_df %>% mutate(State = toupper(id))
#anti_join(data_full, m1790_df, by = "State")
data_full_wmap <- full_join(data_full, m1790_df, by = "State")

#data_full_wmap %>% glimpse


#data_full_wmap %>% filter(Year == 1790) %>% summary()
  # this tells us that the only variable recorded this year is 'SLAVES'. We will use that.

#data_full_wmap %>%
#  filter(Year == 1790) %>% 
#  ggplot(aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) + 
#  geom_polygon(aes(fill = log(SLAVES)), colour = "black") + 
#  theme_bw() + theme(legend.title = element_blank()) + labs(title = "Total Slaves (log scale)")

data_full_wmap_1790 <- data_full_wmap %>% filter(Year == 1790)

ggplot() + geom_polygon(data = mcurr_df, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group), 
                        colour = "grey90", fill = "white") + ggthemes::theme_map() + 
  geom_polygon(data = data_full_wmap_1790, 
               aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = SLAVES)) + 
  scale_fill_gradient(trans = "log10", labels = comma, low = "bisque", high = "darkred") +
  theme(legend.title = element_blank(), legend.background = element_rect(fill = "transparent")) + 
  labs(title = "Total Slaves", x = "", y = "") 
```

With a visualization of the slave population in the United States in 1790 in hand (see Figure 6), it is possible to look at subsequent years of the decennial census in a similar manner to see how the population changes over time.  



```{r, fig.width = 8.33, fig.height = 5, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.pos = "H", fig.cap = "Number of Slaves, Number of Free Colored Persons, and Percentage of Free Colored Persons in 1820."}

Jumping to the year 1820, and again filtering on that particular year, we learn new information about the African American population. The census at this time includes a count of `TOTAL.FREE.COLORED.PERSONS`, as there are citizens who are African American or other minorities that are free, and not slaves. At this time, many minorities were grouped together in the "colored persons" category, and as before, we do not have any other record for African Americans except this categorization and the "slaves" categorization. However, since the 1820 census included records for both `TOTAL.FREE.COLORED.PERSONS` and `TOTAL.SLAVES`, we can also now visualize the percentage of African Americans in each state that were categorized as "free persons" as opposed to slaves (see Figure 7). Knowing that both of these variables are available allows for a powerful comparison by visualizing the growing divide between northern and southern states in the United States at that time.  

```{r, fig.width = 8.33, fig.height = 5, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.pos = "H", fig.cap = "Number of Slaves, Number of Free Colored Persons, Percentage of Free Colored Persons, and Total Colored Persons in 1850."}

# We also now have many northern states who do not report slaves as part of their census, since they were considered free states 
## look up the laws about this

Moving forward in time, even more information can be gleaned about this population. When we subset on the year 1850, we see that although there is still a `TOTAL.SLAVES` column in the record, many states no longer record this variable; by then, they had already abolished slavery. We can transform these `NA` values into zeros to account for this difference in the data and allow us to still calculate the percentages of free African Americans. Starting in 1850, we can also start investigating what the total African American population looks like in each state, beyond just the size of the slave population and freed population (see Figure 8).

The total African American population is particularly interesting moving forward after slavery is abolished in the 1860s and some migration begins to occur out of certain areas. The balance of the total African American population in each state begins to change as the United States transitions into the post-slavery period (see Figure 9). We also see how the boundaries of states change and new states are formed, with the United States gaining new states at each census.

A period of growth and change can be seen at the turn of the 20th century as well, with a dramatic shift in the African American population out west to California and with the balance in the east and midwest shifting slightly further north (see Figure 10). Although the highest density of colored persons is still in the southern states, we can see that of a northern migration is taking place.   



\section{Discussion}  
The decennial census is a rich source of historical information. We have built a tool that can help extract and visualize that information to, for example, understand how demographic attributes of the U.S. population have changed over time.  

Although there is no county-level information available and the data for the census browser go only through 1960, users are able to efficiently explore variables of interest at different time points in U.S. history and tell a visual story about a growing nation and a changing population. This connectivity across years and ability to assess what information was available when, all in one browser, have the potential to save time and effort of researchers interested in delving into United States history.

The structure of our browsers also helps determine not only the variables that are available in a given year, but also where information is missing for some states on a particular variable. Finding these differences is easier when all relevant varialbes are combined in one data frame, which can be summarized and searched all at one time. 


\section{Ongoing Work}  

To investigate even more complex patterns in United States history, it would be helpful to have a finer grid of information - specifically county-level data. There are inherent challenges with a more complex set of data such as county-level, such as lack of continuity across counties and states. Another big challenge would be to construct a layout in which users can interact with years, but also with differences across locales to find the most complete information about variables of interest. Despite these anticipated challenges, adding county-level data to this browser would give researchers a much richer resource with which to work.  

The census adapts and changes with each passing decade. Different variables are tracked, congressional boundaries change, and the demographic landscape of the United States changes as well. If we could add current information (through 2010) and if we were able to update information as it is collected we would then be able to juxtapose today's population with that of the past. Being able to put history into context is important, and an up-to-date census browser could help students and researchers alike who wish to work with historical census information.
